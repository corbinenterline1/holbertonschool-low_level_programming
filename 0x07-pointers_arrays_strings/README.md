 # 0x07 - C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
Task # | Short Description
-------|------------
[Task 0](0-memset.c) | Fills first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b`, returns a pointer to the memory area `s`
[Task 1](1-memcpy.c) | Copies `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`, returns a pointer to `dest`
[Task 2](2-strchr.c) | Locates a character in a string, returns a pointer to the first occurence of the character `c` in the string `s`, or `NULL` if character not found
[Task 3](3-strspn.c) | Gets the length of a prefix substring, returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of `s` which consist only of bytes from `accept`
[Task 4](4-strpbrk.c) | Locates the first occurence in the string `s` of any of the bytes in the string `accept`, returns a pointer to the byte in `s` that matches one of the bytes in `accept`, or `NULL` if no such byte is found
[Task 5](5-strstr.c) | Finds the first occurrence of the substring `needle` in the string `haystack`, returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or `NULL` if substring is not found
[Task 6](7-print_chessboard.c) | Prints a chessboard
[Task 7](8-print_diagsums.c) | Prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
[Task 8](9-set_string.c) | Sets the value of a pointer to a char
[Task 9](101-crackme_password) | Contains the password for the [crackme2](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x06.c) executable (**INCOMPLETE**)
