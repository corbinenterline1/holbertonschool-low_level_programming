[Task 0](0-preprocessor) | Runs a C file through preprocessor only
[Task 1](1-compiler) | Compiles a C file but does not link
[Task 2](2-assembler) | Generates the assembly code of a C code & saves the output
[Task 3](3-name) | Compiles a C file & creates executable named `cisfun`
[Task 4](4-puts.c) | Using puts, prints an exact string
[Task 5](5-printf.c) | Using printf, prints an exact string
[Task 6](6-size.c) | Prints the size of various data types, for x32 & x64
[Task 7](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-compiling-c-code-using-gcc-corbin-enterline) | Blog post covering what happens when you type `gcc main.c`
[Task 8](100-intel) | Generates  assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code & saves into an output file
[Task 9](101-quote.c) | Prints an exact string without using printf or puts (**INCOMPLETE**)
