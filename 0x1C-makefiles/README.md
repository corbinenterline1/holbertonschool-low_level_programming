 # 0x17 - C - Makefiles
Task # | Short Description
-------|------------
[Task 0](0-Makefile) | My first Makefile! Executable: `holberton`. Rules: `all`. Builds executable.
[Task 1](1-Makefile) | Make file from 0 with variables `CC`: compiler to be used, & `SRC`: the `.c` files
[Task 2](2-Makefile) | Additional variables, and change all to recompile only updated source files.
[Task 3](3-Makefile) | Add new rules, and a new variable.
[Task 4](4-Makefile) | Complete makefile!
[Task 5](5-island_perimeter.py) | **Technical interview prep.** Create function `def island_perimeter(grid):` that returns the perimeter of the island described in `grid`, which is a list of integers.
[Task 6](100-Makefile) | **ADVANCED** Fancy makefile!
